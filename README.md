# Automatic-PVR-Converter

Software to automatically convert PowerVR images to png image files.

Instructions:

Put all desired PVR files into the "pvrs" folder, and run the program.
If the images look under-saturated make sure to say yes to gamma correction.
and of course if the images are upside-down say yes to flipping them.

In most cases leaving the file extension as .pvr will suffice, but sometimes games will use different formats like .ktx.
